### 
I studied Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Computing with Games Development at Institute of Technology Tralee and for my thesis I made “Procedural Building Generation” in Unity. Later I studied Master of Science by Research in Machine Learning For Predicting and Analysing Water Quality at Munster Technological University and represented my university at “The 11th International Conference on Applied Informatics in Eger, Hungary, January 29–31, 2020”

One of the first projects in my past was browser based MMO Wiltarius, written in PHP and JavaScript, it was mostly accessed by my friends and their friends. It had a population of around 100 users. It allowed the player to pick human or several alien races and survive being a gladiator on an alien entertainment ship.

My thesis “Procedural Building Generation in Unity” allowed me to create buildings either by code or in unity editor. A level designer could put walls like in the game “The Sims” to create a building of his choice. It did not use preexisting components, instead it made mesh of the walls by code by calculating its vertices, triangles and normals. Walls were made by segments, which could be plain walls or have windows or doors in them. It optimised it by merging plains walls that were in succession. It was capable of saving calculated meshes and allowed its editing at runtime.

I represented my university at “The 11th International Conference on Applied Informatics in Eger, Hungary, January 29–31, 2020”

I was also one of the instructors at two weeklong summer camp „Goalmine Summer Camp” at Institute of Technology Tralee.
